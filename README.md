A 3D-tank game prototype with Unity and C#

I took part in Jyväskylä Gamelab in 2016 in order to learn about game development. I learned some basics of Unity and some C# as
we created this 3D Tank Shooter game within a span of two months. I am not including the entire project with all the prefabs and 
other graphics as they are not created by me, as I was only involved with writing the game prototype's code. 

I should add that this was never supposed to be a complete game. Our goal was to create a prototype with a rather tight 
schedule and luckily we managed to do that. 

I am sharing the C#- scripts from the game, some actual screenshots and our prototype game in a ZIP file (Windows only).
